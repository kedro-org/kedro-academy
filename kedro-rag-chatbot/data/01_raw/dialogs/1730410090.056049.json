    "text": "Hey Kedro!\nWe are migrating to the latest versions of `kedro` and `kedro-datasets` and we are confused with the new `geopandas.GenericDataset`\nWe have an error that suggests problems with dependencies but we did install the specific group of kedro-datasets using pip. We checked the source code and the class is defined. Geopandas is installed too.\nHere's the dataset in the catalog:\n```renab_geoloc_vul:\n  filepath: data/vectors/renab/renab_vul_geoloc.geojson\n  type: geopandas.GenericDataset\n  versioned: false```\nHere's the error:\n```DatasetError: An exception occurred when parsing config for dataset 'renab_geoloc_vul': You can only set the value of existing options. Please see the documentation on how to install relevant dependencies for kedro_datasets.geopandas.GenericDataset:\n<https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/kedro_project_setup/dependencies.html#install-dependencies-related-to-the-data-catalog>```\nCan you help please ? :pray:",
