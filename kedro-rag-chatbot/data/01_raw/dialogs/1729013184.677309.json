    "text": "I have a question about the memory dataset's default copy method. I noticed that if the data is a pandas dataframe or a numpy array that copy rather than assignment (i.e. making a reference) is used by default. I'm wondering what the rationale for that is. Often making a reference is cheaper in terms of runtime than making either a shallow or deep copy. Why is assignment not the top priority default?\n\n<https://docs.kedro.org/en/stable/_modules/kedro/io/memory_dataset.html#MemoryDataset>",

Running twice the same pipeline with the exact same configuration could lead to different results :exploding_head:  The order is now deterministic but <@U03S12LHNNQ> reason is still valid though\n• You can change the default behaviour with a factory in your catalog:\n`{default}:\n    type: Memory dataset\n    copy_mode: assign`"
