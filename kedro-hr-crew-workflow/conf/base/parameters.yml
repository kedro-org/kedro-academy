# Project parameters

# Resume identifier - single parameter for both input file and output file prefixes
# The resume_id is generated by the upstream system that:
#   1. Receives the resume (e.g., from email, upload, queue)
#   2. Generates a unique resume_id
#   3. Saves the resume as {resume_id}.docx in data/sample/resumes/
#   4. Triggers the pipeline with --params resume_id={resume_id}
#
# Usage: kedro run --params resume_id=se
resume_id: "${runtime_params:resume_id, ds}"
