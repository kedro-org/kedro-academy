      description: Parse the raw resume text and extract structured candidate information including name, email, skills, work history, and education. Normalize the data into the CandidateProfile format and extract evidence snippets for downstream matching.
      
      expected_output: A JSON object containing two keys: "candidate_profile" (normalized CandidateProfile object) and "evidence_snippets" (list of evidence snippet objects). The candidate_profile must include: candidate_id (string), name (string), email (string), skills (array of strings), work_history (array of objects with company, role, duration, description), education (array of objects with institution, degree, field, year), and raw_resume_text (string). The evidence_snippets must be an array of objects with snippet_id, text, source, and metadata fields. Format as valid JSON matching the schemas provided.
      
      agent: resume_parser
      
      Raw Resume Text:
      {{raw_resume_text}}
      
      Candidate ID:
      {{candidate_id}}
      
      CRITICAL RULES - READ CAREFULLY:
      - ONLY extract information that is EXPLICITLY stated in the provided resume text above
      - NEVER invent, infer, guess, or create information that is not present in the resume
      - NEVER use information from your training data or general knowledge
      - If information is missing, use these defaults:
        * name: "Unknown" (if name not found)
        * email: "unknown@example.com" (if email not found)
        * skills: [] (empty array if no skills section found)
        * work_history: [] (empty array if no work experience found)
        * education: [] (empty array if no education found)
        * field: null (if no field/minor mentioned)
        * year: null (if no year mentioned)
      - Extract text EXACTLY as written in the resume - do not paraphrase or summarize
      - Preserve ALL punctuation, capitalization, sentence structure, and formatting exactly as it appears in the resume
      - Do NOT add or remove periods, commas, colons, or any other punctuation marks
      - Do NOT reformat or restructure sentences - copy them exactly as written
      - If you cannot find a piece of information, use the default value - do not make it up
      
      Instructions:
      1. Extract the candidate's name from the resume (typically at the top). If not found, use "Unknown"
      2. Extract email address (look for "Email:" or email patterns). If not found, use "unknown@example.com"
      3. Extract all skills from the Technical Skills, Skills, or similar sections. Extract each skill as a separate string. If no skills section found, return empty array []
      4. Extract work history entries with:
         - Company name (extract exactly as written)
         - Job role/title (extract exactly as written)
         - Duration/date range (extract exactly as written)
         - Description/achievements (combine all achievement points exactly as written, preserve original text)
      5. Extract education entries with:
         - Institution name (extract exactly as written)
         - Degree name (extract exactly as written)
         - Field/Minor/Relevant Coursework (extract if "Minor:" or "Relevant Coursework:" is mentioned, otherwise null)
         - Year of completion (only if explicitly mentioned, otherwise null)
      6. Create evidence snippets from:
         - Each skill (source: "skills", snippet_id format: "skill_1", "skill_2", etc.)
         - Each work history entry (source: "work_history", snippet_id format: "work_1", "work_2", etc.)
         - Each education entry (source: "education", snippet_id format: "edu_1", "edu_2", etc.)
      7. CRITICAL for evidence snippets text field - EXTRACT EXACTLY AS WRITTEN:
         - For work history snippets: Format as "{Role} at {Company} | {Duration}: {Description}"
           * Use the EXACT description text from the resume - preserve ALL punctuation, sentence breaks, and formatting
           * If the resume has periods at the end of sentences, keep them. If it doesn't, don't add them
           * If sentences are separated by periods in the resume, keep them separated. If they're on separate lines, join them with periods
           * Copy the description text character-by-character from the resume - do not reformat or restructure
         - For education snippets: Format as "{Degree} from {Institution} | {Year}: {Field/Coursework}"
           * If the resume includes labels like "Minor:", "Relevant Coursework:", "Coursework:", etc., preserve them EXACTLY as written
           * Include the label text exactly as it appears (e.g., "Minor: Computer Science" not just "Computer Science")
           * Preserve all punctuation and formatting from the original resume text
         - For skill snippets: Use the exact skill name as written in the resume
         - GENERAL RULE: Copy text verbatim from the resume - do not add, remove, or modify any characters, punctuation, or formatting
      8. Ensure all dates, names, and text are extracted EXACTLY as written - do not modify or infer
      9. Handle variations in section names and formatting, but only extract what is actually present
      10. Preserve the original raw_resume_text exactly as provided in the candidate_profile
      11. Validate that all extracted information exists in the resume text before including it
      
      Return ONLY valid JSON with "candidate_profile" and "evidence_snippets" keys. Do not include any explanatory text, only the JSON.
