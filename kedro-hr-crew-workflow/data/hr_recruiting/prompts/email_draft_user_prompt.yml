      description: Draft a professional, empathetic email to the candidate based on the screening recommendation. Use the Email Draft Tool to create the email - the tool has access to the candidate's name and job title. The email should acknowledge their application, provide clear next steps, maintain a positive and respectful tone, and include appropriate feedback when relevant. Use the candidate's actual name from the tool, not a placeholder.
      
      expected_output: An EmailDraft object containing: subject (professional email subject line), body (well-crafted email body with appropriate tone that includes the candidate's name and relevant details), and placeholders (candidate_name and job_title). Format as valid JSON matching the EmailDraft schema.
