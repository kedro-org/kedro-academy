# Kedro Training

This repository contains legacy materials used previously for basic [Kedro](https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro) training. The content is based on the standard [spaceflights tutorial described in the Kedro documentation](https://kedro.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/spaceflights_tutorial.html).

The training documentation was most recently updated against Kedro 0.17.2 in March 2021.

To get started, navigate to [training_docs](./training_docs/01_welcome.md) to see what is covered.

> **Note**
> These materials come from https://github.com/kedro-org/kedro-training, now archived.
