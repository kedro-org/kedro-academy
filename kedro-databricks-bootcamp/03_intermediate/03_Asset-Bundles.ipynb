    "# Databricks Asset Bundles to deploy a Kedro project\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Deploying Kedro pipelines to Databricks using asset bundles offers a streamlined way to productionise data workflows. Asset bundles package your Kedro project—including code, dependencies, and configuration—into a self-contained artifact that can be uploaded and executed on Databricks. This approach simplifies deployment by separating development from execution, ensuring reproducibility and minimizing setup overhead. Once the asset bundle is built, it can be run as a Databricks job, making it easier to schedule and monitor pipelines in a scalable cloud environment.\n"
